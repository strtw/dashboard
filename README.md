This dashboard is written in React as an exercise in creating maintainable, modular UI components.

###  [Presentation on my development process](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTp_DVyPAzO0Y6e9qGpYBlQxZc8hktadwY2_5D9hCH14IOyekXlb9y-gma5fohTv_1X7nBiBM0oJPX1/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000)

### Key Features

#### Successful Implementation 
- Create React App used for configuration, which includes compilation errors and warnings and live reload for iterative development

### Maintainability / Readability
- BEM naming convention used to namespace CSS, create semantic meaning to components, increase maintainability and readability

### Flexibility of code to changing requirements
- Atomic design used to compose a hierarchical, modular UI
- CSS Flexbox used to create responsive layout at component level. 
- Classnames utility used to enable CSS application of classes at the React Component level
- ES6 modules used to decouple chart data from chart React component
- Content breakpoints used to reproduce design intent on largest number of devices, now and in future


### Reusability of code for other applications
- Modular React components
- SCSS partials used to create modular CSS styles, framework independent.  
- 7-1 file structure to create logical, repeatable folder structure
- DRY principles used in SCSS variables, mixins, functions
